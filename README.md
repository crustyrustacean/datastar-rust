An implementation of the [Datastar] SDK in Rust
with framework integration for [Actix Web], [Axum], [Rocket], and [Warp].

Supports Datastar **1.0.4**. Its SSE event format and SDK defaults are unchanged
from 1.0.3.

Rust web frameworks own SSE stream lifecycle and backpressure, so this SDK
intentionally returns framework-native events instead of providing a
`ServerSentEventGenerator`.

[Rama](https://github.com/plabayo/rama) has its own SDK implementation defined as a [Rama module for Datastar](https://ramaproxy.org/docs/rama/http/sse/datastar/index.html) as can be seen in action in [this example](https://github.com/plabayo/rama/blob/main/examples/http_sse_datastar_hello.rs).

# Usage

Runnable examples for every supported framework can be found in
[`examples`](./examples).

Framework integrations are opt-in:

| Feature | Module |
| --- | --- |
| `actix-web` | `datastar::actix_web` |
| `axum` | `datastar::axum` |
| `rocket` | `datastar::rocket` |
| `warp` | `datastar::warp` |

### Actix Web

Enable the `actix-web` feature to use the Actix Web signal extractor and
conversions into Actix Web's native SSE events:

```toml
[dependencies]
actix-web = "4"
actix-web-lab = {
    git = "https://github.com/crustyrustacean/actix-web-lab.git",
    rev = "3a9ffda1de641fe40560fbdd231dca4544f4945c",
    default-features = false,
}
datastar = {
    git = "https://github.com/crustyrustacean/datastar-rust.git",
    branch = "feat/actix-adapter",
    features = ["actix-web"],
}
tokio-stream = "0.1"
```

The adapter exposes `datastar::actix_web::ReadSignals` and converts
`PatchElements`, `PatchSignals`, `ExecuteScript`, and `DatastarEvent` into
`actix_web_lab::sse::Event` values:

```rust
use actix_web_lab::sse::Sse;
use datastar::prelude::PatchElements;

async fn handler() -> impl actix_web::Responder {
    let event = PatchElements::new("<div id=\"message\">Hello</div>")
        .write_as_actix_web_sse_event();

    Sse::from_infallible_stream(tokio_stream::iter([event]))
}
```

The `actix-web-lab` Git dependency is temporary. This fork pins the revision
above because it contains the per-message SSE `retry` support required by the
adapter, which is not yet available in the published lab release. Once that
SSE work is promoted and released, replace the Git dependency with the
released version. Applications that use `actix-web-lab` types directly should
pin the same revision until then.

## QUERY requests

Datastar 1.0.4 adds `@query('/endpoint')`, which sends a `QUERY` request with
signals in the JSON body. GET and DELETE continue to send signals in the
`datastar` URL query parameter.

- **Actix Web:** `datastar::actix_web::ReadSignals<T>` reads QUERY bodies.
  Route the method with `web::method(Method::from_bytes(b"QUERY")?)`; the
  built-in method guards do not cover custom methods. See
  [`actix-test-suite`](./examples/actix-test-suite.rs).
- **Axum:** `ReadSignals<T>` reads QUERY bodies. Route the method using
  `axum::routing::any` or a method-router fallback; `MethodFilter` does not
  support custom methods. See [`axum-test-suite`](./examples/axum-test-suite.rs)
  for a fallback that accepts QUERY and rejects other unhandled methods.
- **Warp:** `read_signals::<T>()` reads QUERY bodies. Use `warp::method()` to
  match `method.as_str() == "QUERY"`, as in
  [`warp-test-suite`](./examples/warp-test-suite.rs).
- **Rocket 0.5:** custom HTTP methods are rejected before reaching a handler.
  Use `@post('/endpoint')` and a `ReadSignals<T>` data guard instead.

The new free Datastar Rocket browser bundle is unrelated to Rust's Rocket
framework. It uses the same SDK events. The other
[1.0.4 release changes](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/releases/tag/v1.0.4),
including CSP nonce aliases, request cancellation, and signal reactivity fixes,
are handled by the browser bundle.

## Long-lived streams

A long-lived SSE handler can receive updates from any number of application
tasks. Publish server-side state changes through channels such as
`tokio::sync::watch` or `tokio::sync::broadcast`, then wait on all receivers in
the handler with `tokio::select!`. Requests that change state only need to
publish an update; the existing SSE response remains open and sends the
corresponding Datastar event.

The [`axum-watch`](./examples/axum-watch.rs) example demonstrates three
independent `watch` channels feeding one SSE response. The
[`rocket-hello-channel`](./examples/rocket-hello-channel.rs) example shows the
same basic pattern with Rocket.

## SDK conformance

Run the official Datastar SDK suite against Actix Web, Axum, Rocket, and Warp
with Go:

```sh
make test-datastar-sdk
```

Or run the official test runner in Docker:

```sh
make test-datastar-sdk-docker
```

The runner defaults to the suite at Datastar 1.0.4 and also checks QUERY routing
and responses for Actix Web, Axum, and Warp. Set `DATASTAR_SDK_TEST_VERSION=latest` to test
against the newest upstream suite.
